## Vehicle Pollution Monitoring System
Developed a vehicle pollution monitoring system using ESP32 microcontroller, programmed in C++. The system continuously measures pollution levels using MQ7 and MQ2 gas sensors, notifying owners if CO and smoke value limits are exceeded. Integrated RFID reader sends vehicle details and pollution data to authorities via SMS and email using the Blynk app. Aims to mitigate vehicular emissions and promote environmental responsibility. ðŸš—ðŸŒ±

### Key features include:

- Continuous monitoring of pollution levels emitted by vehicles.
- Instant notifications to vehicle owners if pollution levels exceed permissible limits.
- Integration of an RFID reader for authorized personnel to scan RFID tags at checkpoints.
- Automatic transmission of vehicle details, including registration number and owner information, along with pollution data to authorities via SMS and email.
- Utilization of the Blynk app for seamless internet-based communication.
